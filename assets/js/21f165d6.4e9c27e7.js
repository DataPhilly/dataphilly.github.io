This talk explores why the sequence of data is important, and examples of how it influences data engineering solutions. We\u2019ll start by going over the definition of sequential data organization and comparisons to non-sequential data. The remainder of the talk will focus on concrete examples of how sequence fundamentally changes how we analyze and process data from both a business perspective, specifically financial information at Perpay, as well as within technical data engineering services, such as how Apache Kafka handles delivery semantics to facilitate reliable processing.
