The business impact of this technology was significant, allowing customers to drill down deeply into their data, and resulted in a premium tier of pricing for our customers. In the second part of our talk, we'll go over how we combined technologies in computer vision and transformers to reduce customer onboarding time by 80%. We fine tuned a Hugging Face model, combined with open-source segmentation methods to allow customers to simply snap a picture of their assets to register them instead of manually inputting every piece of data.
