This presentation explores these divergent paths' ethical, technical, and societal implications. It underscores the urgent need for robust AI governance and data governance to steer innovation toward equitable and accountable outcomes.\nThis discussion contrasts the risks of unchecked autonomy (e.g., biased algorithms, opaque decision-making) with the promise of human-centered AI collaboration (e.g., contextual and layered explainability). It examines how governance frameworks like the EU AI Act, NIST AI Risk Framework, and sector-specific regulations can mitigate harm while fostering trust in AI systems.\nThe presentation also addresses critical implementation challenges, including regulatory fragmentation, model evaluation challenges, algorithmic transparency gaps, and the tension between innovation speed and ethical safeguards. By advocating for hybrid governance models that blend proactive risk assessments, dynamic consent mechanisms, and cross-sector collaboration, the talk offers actionable strategies to align AI development with societal values.\nUltimately, this session argues that the choice between Terminator and Tricorder futures hinges not on technological capability but on AI governance. Policymakers, technologists, and civil society must collaborate to ensure that AI remains a force that empowers human agency, equity, and safety."]}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(t.p,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Speaker Bio:"}),"\nBrian M.
