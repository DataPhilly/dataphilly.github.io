This got me thinking: How would each front-end framework implement this functionality? What would be the Angular Way or the Vue Way? Which technology is the least complex and makes the most sense for my brain?\nWith AstroJS, you can build these kinds of applications. Do you want to put a React component next to a Vue component? You can do that in Astro. In this presentation, I will walk you through how I built checkboxes.xyz, a website that showcases nested checkboxes in different front-end frameworks. I will share some fun tidbits along the way. A semi-viral X/Twitter post, getting dunked on r/webdev, and even accepting a PR from a stranger who added the Stimulus framework.\nAttendees will gain insights into cross-framework development, learn my approach to 'working in public', and come away with practical knowledge they can apply to their own projects."]}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(n.strong,{children:"Speaker Bio:"}),"\nWith over a decade of experience in the geospatial industry, I specialize in developing and scaling geospatial applications that transform complex data into actionable insights.
